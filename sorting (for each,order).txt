 Aim :to execute Sort, group and filter command:

Steps/code
1.	Download covid 19 data from Kaggle. Clean the data. Save as (csv file)
2.	Load data in pig storage
3.	Display data 
Perform following task:

data1 = LOAD 'C:\\Users\\sagar\\Download\\data.csv' USING PigStorage(',')
   as (Country_Region:chararray, Continent:chararray, Population:long, TotalCases:long, TotalDeaths:long, TotalRecovered:long, TotalCasesPer1M:double, DeathPer1M:double);

Dump data1;

To display the field name entered in schema
DESCRIBE data1;

To display the selected fields
two = foreach data1 generate Country_Region, TotalDeaths, TotalRecovered;

Identified the countries having less number of deaths. 
data1_order = ORDER data1 BY death ASC;

Identify the countries which have maximum number of recoveries
data1_recover = ORDER data1 BY recovered DESC;

Extract 10 countries whose death over 1 million population is maximum
data1_deathpop = ORDER data1 BY deathpop DESC;
data1_limit = LIMIT data1_deathpop 10;

Filter data having cases per 1 million population is more than 1 lac
data1_filter = FILTER data1 BY (casepop>100000);

Group the countries continentwise:
data1_group = GROUP data1 By continent;
